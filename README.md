# My-FIRST-Algorithm

The goal of this algorithm is to, one, learn recursion, and second, learn how to use a counter for an iterative/recursional algorith. I want there to be a thread running through each recursion.

This is a documentation of progress through my first RECURSIVE algorithm. I made this to undertstand the operation of recursion. After I have finished this factorial algorithm, I will make a fibonacci one that prints the sum of each fibonacci succeeding the original input. 
In this program I want to utilize the pointer feature in the language of C.
