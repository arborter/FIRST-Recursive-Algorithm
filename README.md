# My-FIRST-Algorithm

This is a documentation of progress through my first RECURSIVE algorithm. I made this to undertstand the operation of recursion. After I have finished this factorial algorithm, I will make a fibonacci one that prints the sum of each fibonacci succeeding the original input. 
In this program I want to utilize the pointer feature in the language of C.
